            <h2 class="quotes">“It’s really about this idea that they’re not friends anymore but I’ve </h2>
            <h2 class="quotes"> tried to reach out and it’s just not gonna work anymore” </h2>
            <h2 class="quotes"><i>-Ruel Vincent Van Dijk</i></h2>

        </div>
        <p class="story-text">Most teenage songs now are generally centered around love. But in Ruel’s track “Younger,” the song details the dissolution of another important connection that we build with other people: friendship. This song really hit me hard, during the pandemic, my friends and I grew further apart. I related to the feelings that Ruel is trying to convey in this song.</p>

        <p class="story-text">In the first verse, he references their rebellious times together, specifically sneaking out and “walking the streets at night.” He closes the verse with the first hint that two friends have grown apart and gone their separate ways. Ruel follows with the pre-chorus, which keeps the narrative on how things truly aren’t the same.  He’s clearly perturbed, leading into the aforementioned chorus where the brotherhood has ceased.  In the second verse, he mentions how his former friend has physically changed, singing, “I didn’t even recognize you.” On the bridge, however, he is trying to be assertive in rekindling things, but his efforts are going nowhere.</p>

        <p></p><p></p>
        
        <p class="story-text">Moreover, Ruel is on-point throughout “Younger.” First and foremost, this 15-year-old has an awesome voice, filled with expression, nuance, and soulfulness. He definitely sounds older which accentuated his emotions in the song.  The grit and the passion he sings with are magnificent, the tones and melody in the song sets a vibe for the listeners feel his sentiment in the song.  Secondly, the message conveyed through the songwriting is relatable to everyone on some level.  Everyone had a friendship that they just wished would last forever. Finally, the soulful, gospel-infused vibe is fitting given the yearning, regretful, and reminiscent nature of this track.</p>

        <p class="story-text">In essence, the song tells us that friends change, people move away, and most of our friendships will not last forever. Every beat, every note, and every tone, Ruel pushes me in a rollercoaster ride of nostalgia. The song taught the listeners a golden lesson in life, “no friendships last forever.” And even though it hurts; you have to look up and move forward. It’d be great if you could freeze time and take all those wonderful friends you have and keep them just as they are.

        </p>
        <p class="story-text">Beautiful artwork and animation aside, one of the defining features of Makoto Shinkai’s 5 Centimeters Per Second is its music, and within the soundtrack, “One More Time, One More Chance” stands out for being such a fitting song because it brings to light the sorrows, regrets, and frustrations that the main character, Takaki, experiences over the course of the movie.</p>
